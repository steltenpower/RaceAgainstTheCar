Many people work a day a week to pay their car, but here I'll only focus on traveling time of cars compared to bikes.
Highest topspeed doesn't always mean lowest travel time from A to B, especially during rush hour, or in city centres.
Navigation systems often treat cars like taxis; not taking parking into account. This will try better.

Comparing isochrones ...
========================
Isochrones are lines showing how far you can get in any direction in a certain timespan, from a specific start point.
Maybe locations where loads of people come by car not knowing bikes are faster for their situation (e.g. [Dutch elementary schools](https://www.duo.nl/open_onderwijsdata/databestanden/po/adressen/adressen-po-3.jsp)), need a big image with several competing isochrones on its wall, website and Google Maps pin (just dream, right).
Though cars all go as fast as the vehicle in front, or what the road allows, there's a huge variation in how fast (e-)bikes go.

... Interactively
=================
Higher speeds give bigger isochrones; So what if instead of the static isochrones on the wall you connect a (big) screen to a (hometrainer) bike?
To make the map easier to read overlap it with a green transparent layer for destinations that are quicker to reach by bike.

If you can't win by bike yet
============================
The fastest option might be walking into your homeoffice or garden with your notebook or VRglasses, but as biking is healthy exercise you could also combine it with taking a train. Shorter driving times are helped by less cars a lot more than by expensive extra car infrastructure, so either way vote for bike-friendly parties.
